- Identified missing values and duplicates
- Standardized date formats
- Cleaned categorical fields
- Performed feature engineering (OrderYear, OrderMonth)
- Merged datasets into one analysis-ready table

## Files Included
- `notebooks/01_data_profiling.ipynb` – exploration and profiling
- `scripts/data_cleaning.py` – reproducible cleaning pipeline
- `data/cleaned/cleaned_dataset.csv` – final cleaned dataset

## Output
A cleaned, merged, analysis-ready dataset suitable for further analytics or visualization.

## Tools Used
